# Proof Blockchain Nodes (Layer 3)

## Overview

Proof Blockchain Nodes represents the Layer 3 implementation of the Proof Blockchain ecosystem. This repository focuses on privacy-preserving, ultra-fast transaction processing using ZK-Rollups technology. It is a critical component that enables Proof Blockchain to achieve unparalleled transaction throughput while maintaining strong privacy guarantees and seamless integration with the other layers of the network.

## Features

- **ZK-Rollups Implementation**: High-throughput, privacy-preserving transaction processing
- **Full and Light Nodes**: Support for both full validation and lightweight client nodes
- **Privacy Mechanisms**: Advanced cryptographic techniques for transaction privacy
- **Off-chain Data Management**: Efficient handling of off-chain data with on-chain availability proofs
- **API Endpoints**: RPC and REST APIs for interacting with the network
- **Proof Generation and Verification**: Efficient zero-knowledge proof systems

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.55.0 or later
- Cargo
- Git
- LLVM and Clang (for certain cryptographic operations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/proof-blockchain/proof-nodes.git
   cd proof-nodes
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Usage

To run a full node:

```
cargo run --release -- --node-type full --config-path /path/to/config.toml
```

To run a light node:

```
cargo run --release -- --node-type light --config-path /path/to/config.toml
```

Make sure to configure your `config.toml` file with appropriate settings for your node type.

## Configuration

The `config.toml` file should include the following sections:

- `[network]`: P2P network configuration
- `[zk_rollups]`: ZK-Rollups parameters
- `[privacy]`: Privacy settings
- `[api]`: API configuration
- `[storage]`: Off-chain storage settings

Refer to the `config.example.toml` file in the repository for a complete example.

## Architecture

The proof-nodes repository is structured as follows:

- `src/node/`: Implementation of full and light nodes
- `src/zk_rollups/`: ZK-Rollups logic including provers and verifiers
- `src/privacy/`: Privacy-enhancing features and zero-knowledge systems
- `src/network/`: P2P networking and synchronization
- `src/api/`: RPC and REST API implementations
- `src/storage/`: Off-chain data storage and management
